# Task-3-Call-Center-Analytics


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is an internship analysis of **call center performance data** for **January 2023**, focusing on customer interactions, agent efficiency, and call outcomes. Using a dashboard-based approach, the project evaluates patterns in answered vs. unanswered calls, customer segmentation, wait times, and agent workload distribution.

The insights generated are intended to help the organization improve **customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and service quality**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis were:

* Evaluate **call traffic patterns** and answered vs. unanswered call ratios.
* Analyze **agent performance** and workload balance.
* Assess **customer segmentation** by type (Enterprise, Premium, Standard).
* Study **call prioritization** (High, Medium, Low) and its effectiveness.
* Measure **average wait times** and their impact on customer experience.
* Apply **probabilistic/statistical models** to call attempts.
* Propose **recommendations** for reducing unanswered calls and improving efficiency.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

* **Total Calls:** 5,000
* **Answered Calls:** 2,520 (50.38%)
* **Unanswered Calls:** 2,480 (49.62%)
* **Agents Involved:** \~10 (250â€“300 calls per agent)
* **Customer Segments:** Enterprise, Premium, Standard
* **Call Priorities:** High, Medium, Low
* **Wait Time Recorded:** \~60,000 seconds (\~16.6 hours combined)

---

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology

1. Data collected from **call center logs (January 2023)**.
2. Analyzed using an **interactive dashboard**.
3. Breakdown by:

   * Answered vs. unanswered calls
   * Customer segmentation
   * Priority handling
   * Agent performance
   * Wait time distribution
4. Applied **binomial and geometric probability models** for call attempts.
5. Derived insights and formulated **recommendations**.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

* Nearly **50% of calls remain unanswered**, posing customer service risks.
* **High Priority calls** experienced **longer wait times** than Medium/Low.
* **Premium customers** faced the highest cumulative wait time despite their value.
* Agent workload was balanced, but **performance varied significantly**.
* Repeated call attempts were common, increasing **operational costs**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

* Hire/train more agents during **peak hours**.
* Implement **callback systems** for unanswered calls.
* Introduce **AI-driven call routing** for High Priority & Premium customers.
* Improve **IVR automation** for simple queries.
* Monitor KPIs (Answer Rate, Wait Time, First Call Resolution) regularly.
